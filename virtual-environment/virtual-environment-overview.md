## 🧐 What is Virtual Environment in Python

- It is an isolated environment for Python projects.
- It allows you to install packages in an isolated environment.
- It helps to avoid conflicts between packages in different projects.

## 🤷‍♂️ Why do we need to use Virtual Environment

- **Avoid Dependency Hell**: Different projects may require different versions of the same package. Virtual environments help to avoid conflicts between packages.
- **Simplify Project Setup**: Quickly set up projects with all necessary packages and dependencies contained within the environment.
- **Ensure Compatibility**: Maintain stable versions for each project, helping with reproducibility and consistency, especially in collaborative or deployment settings.

## 🚀 Virtual Environment Managing Tools

There are several tools to manage virtual environments in Python. Some of them are:

- [venv](./venv.md): Python's built-in module available in Python 3.3 and later. It is used to create lightweight virtual environments.

- [virtualenv](./virtualenv.md): A third-party tool that provides more features than `venv`.

- [Conda](./conda.md): A cross-platform, language-agnostic package and environment manager, Conda is part of the Anaconda distribution. It manages packages and dependencies for Python and other languages, making it ideal for data science projects.

- [Pipenv](./pipenv.md): Combining pip and virtualenv, Pipenv simplifies dependency management by creating a Pipfile to specify project dependencies, ensuring reproducible environments.

- [Poetry](./poetry.md): A dependency management and packaging tool, Poetry handles virtual environments automatically and manages dependencies through a pyproject.toml file, streamlining project setup and maintenance.

- [Pyenv](./pyenv.md): Primarily a Python version management tool, pyenv allows you to switch between multiple Python versions. When combined with pyenv-virtualenv, it facilitates the creation and management of virtual environments for different Python versions.
