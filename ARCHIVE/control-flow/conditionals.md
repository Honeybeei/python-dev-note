## 🌟 About Condition and Truthiness

In Python, conditions are evaluated based on their **truthiness**. This means that any expression can be tested for truth value, not just boolean expressions.

- **✅ Truthy values**: Non-zero numbers, non-empty strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
- **❌ Falsy values**: None, False, 0, empty strings (""), empty lists ([]), empty tuples (()), empty dictionaries ({}), and empty sets (set()).
